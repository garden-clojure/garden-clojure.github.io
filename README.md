# Garden

Garden is a library for rendering CSS in Clojure and ClojureScript.
Conceptually similar to [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup), it uses
vectors to represent rules and maps to represent declarations. It is designed
for stylesheet authors who are interested in what's possible when you trade a
preprocessor for a programming language.
